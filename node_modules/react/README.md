So you're a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) user, but want to use some React libraries with it. You wanted to [set up aliases or something](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started#aliasing-react-to-preact), but can't do it for some reason.

The `preact-compat/react` and `preact-compat/react-dom` alias repositories are here for you!
Install them as you would any other npm module, and these aliases will be used from Github:

```
npm i -S preact preact-compat/react preact-compat/react-dom
```

... or for Yarn users:

```sh
yarn add preact preact-compat/react preact-compat/react-dom
```
